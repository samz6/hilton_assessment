Hilton UI Assessment

This is typically given to candidates for the Hilton UI team.  The UI team is responsible for working with designers, user experience architects, and web accessibility specialists to develop front-end assets.  For this reason, fidelity to design, business rules, and awareness of accessible principles are part of the evaluation.  Communication is a key, so please also include a document of assumptions, compromises, or any explanation you'd like to give.

There are two assessments.  There are options in how to return the final product.  If there are no .js files, then returning a zip is fine (Hilton exchange removes contents of zip files that contain .js files).  Alternatively, park the code on github or some other downloadable spot on the web.


Assessment 1:
--------------
Expected final output:
HTML/CSS/JS/supporting images.

Description:
A hotel details web page is going to be served to web users.  A screenshot of the mobile version is provided of what it should look like (test1-mobile-page.png).  Create a static web page from scratch that matches the screenshot, with some responsiveness for varying phone screen sizes.  (The footer is not illustrated - feel free to cut off however you feel appropriate).  Supporting images for this test can be found in /test1_assets/ directory.

The point of this is to show awareness towards:
- Design detail
- Semantic HTML 
- CSS/responsive design
